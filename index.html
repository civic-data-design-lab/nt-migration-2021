  									<p class="about-descr"><b> 2 | </b>Violence, insecurity, and natural disasters have been complex and longstanding triggers of migration, but economic factors were participants’ primary motivation for desiring to emigrate to do so. </p>

  									<p class="about-descr"><b> 6 | </b>Although economic factors were the primary motivators for seeking to migrate, there were notable differences across departments within El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. </p>
              		  				<p class="about-descr"><b> 7 | </b>Reported costs to contract smugglers were not only significantly higher than the costs of using regular mechanisms but also comprised the majority of total annual migration costs. </p>

  							  <p class="about-descr pt-3">This project analizes and visualizes the key findings from a report made in collaboration bewtween the Civic Data Design Lab of the Mssachusetts Institute of Technology, The World Food Programme, the Migration Policy Institute, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Organization of American States.
<br><br>The study relies primarily on household survey data collected by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and international and civil-society partners. Between April and May 2021, the research team conducted interviews with nearly 5,000 households in 300 communities across the following 12 departments: Ahuachapán, Cabañas, San Salvador, and Usulután in El Salvador; Alta Verapaz, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Chiquimula in Guatemala; and Choluteca, Cortés, Francisco Morazán, and Yoro in Honduras (see map below). The survey asked respondents about their living conditions, intentions to migrate, and the sociodemographic characteristics of household members who had migrated, among other related questions. The U.S. Border Patrol encountered approximately 1.8 million There were 1.6 million combined encounters of migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras at the U.S.-Mexico border reached 1.6 million since between fiscal years 2017 and 2021 , surpassing the number of encounters of Mexican migrants and in four of the last five fiscal years encounters of migrants from these three countries surpassed encounters of Mexican migrants. Since 2018, the region has also witnessed larger and more frequent mass movements, including those composed of significant shares of families and unaccompanied children, primarily bound for the United States and motivated by a mix of employment opportunities, family reunification, and humanitarian protection needs.
<br><br>Influenced by an array of pull and push factors, the movement of Central Americans toward the United States has shaped the migration landscape in the region for decades. Yet, recent   changes over the past five years in the volume and characteristics of those on the move have drawn an unprecedented level of attention from regional governments seeking to reduce irregular migration.</p>

  <p class="about-descr pt-3" >At the same time, there is renewed political interest in countries stretching from Panama to Canada in collaboratively addressing the unabating root causes of migration and displacement. This has led to the advancement of regional frameworks that seek to promote safe, orderly, and regular migration with the goal of benefiting migrants and origin and destination communities alike, while contributing to sustainable development and making migration an option, not the only resort to escape country conditions. If this interest can be leveraged and translated into action, governments in the region have a unique and timely opportunity to shift from an enforcement-centered strategy to a more multifaceted migration management system rooted in cooperation.</p>
