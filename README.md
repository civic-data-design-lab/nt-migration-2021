### Origins
Timeline of migrants emigrating from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras related to historic events driven violence, cliimate, food insecurity, and policy.

### Motivations
Map of regions where the UN World Food Programme surveyed 5,000 households in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in April and May 2021. Visualization of migration motivations among households with a recent migrant.

### Profiles
Visualizations of gender and age distribution of migrant demographics and the occupations of migrants before and after emmigration.

### Outcomes
Map of approximated proportions of U.S. metropolitan areas with migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Visualization of the destination outcomes of recent migrants.

### Cost
Visualizations of the aggregated annual estimate and individual costs of migrants from surveyed data. Includes aggregated total, and breakdown for country, pathway of migration, and financing method related to estimated time to pay debt from migration loans.

### About
Includes a project summary, highlights from the key findings, acknowledgements, image credits, and links to download, read or watch the full report, executive summary, press release, and launch presentation.
